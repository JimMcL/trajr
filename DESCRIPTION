Description: A toolbox to assist with statistical analysis of 2-dimensional animal trajectories.
    It provides simple access to algorithms for calculating and assessing a variety of 
    characteristics such as speed and acceleration, as well as multiple measures of 
    straightness or tortuosity. McLean & Skowron Volponi (2018) <doi:10.1111/eth.12739>.
