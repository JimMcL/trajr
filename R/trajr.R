#' trajr: trajectory analysis in R
#'
#' A toolkit for the statistical analysis of 2-dimensional animal trajectories.
#'
#' Trajr operates on trajectories which are arrays of x and y coordinates. It
#' can be used to calculate characteristics such as velocity and acceleration,
#' as well as various measures of straightness or tortuosity.
#'
#' Trajr does not perform object tracking from videos, it operates on existing
#' arrays of coordinates.
