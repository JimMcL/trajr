Trajectory Analysis in R

An R package for analysing 2-dimensional animal trajectories. It provides functions 
to easily calculate various measures of speed and straightness or tortuosity.

`Trajr` does not provide a mechanism to extract trajectories from videos, 
it requires trajectories to already exist as a sequence of x,y coordinates.

## Installation

    $ install.packages("devtools")
    $ devtools::install_github("JimMcL/trajr")
