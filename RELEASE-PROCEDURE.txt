Release procedure
-----------------

Check that all exported functions have been mentioned in the vignette by running check-vignette.sh (from bash). This may require editing to convert to UNIX line endings.

Update version number and date in DESCRIPTION file. See https://semver.org/

Update NEWS.md

Update session info in README.md: devtools::session_info()

Commit and push all changes

Build source package (creates ../trajr_x.y.z.b.tar.gz)

Run (possibly from RStudio terminal window): cd ..; R CMD check --as-cran trajr_x.y.z.b.tar.gz
Perhaps add --no-manual in case of error: pdflatex is not available

Run devtools::check_win_release() and wait for the result

Check CI github action results (CMD check and coverage) by clicking on the badges in the github README

Upload ../trajr_x.y.z.tar.gz to CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/). Use the ‘Optional comment’ field on the webform (and not a separate email) to explain how the feedback on previous submission(s) has been addressed.

-----
Once accepted by CRAN:

Create a new release on GitHub (https://github.com/JimMcL/trajr)

Update version number (in DESCRIPTION) to x.y.z.9000. See http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html#version for rationale for the use of 9000 as a version number.
