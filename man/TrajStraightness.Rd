\title{Straightness of a Trajectory}
\usage{
TrajStraightness(trj)
}
\arguments{
\item{trj}{Trajectory to calculate straightness of.}
}
\value{
The straightness index of \code{trj}, which is a value between 0
  (infinitely tortuous) to 1 (a straight line).
}
\description{
Calculates the straightness index of a trajectory, \eqn{D / L}, where
\code{D} is the beeline distance between the first and last points in the
trajectory,and \code{L} is the path length travelled (Batschelet, 1981).
Benhamou (2004) considers the straightness index to be a reliable measure of
the efficiency of a directed walk, but inapplicable to random trajectories.
The straightness index of a random walk tends towards zero as the number of
steps increases, hence should only be used to compare the tortuosity of
random walks consisting of a similar number of steps.
}
\details{
The straightness index is also known as the net-to-gross displacement ratio.
According to Batschelet (1981), this value (termed \emph{d}) is an
approximation of \emph{r}, which is the length of the mean vector of turning
angles of a constant step-length trajectory (see
\code{\link{TrajMeanVectorOfTurningAngles}} and
\code{\link{TrajRediscretize}} for creating a constant step-length
trajectory).
